
Today was the big breakthrough.

I had been working for months now on the ultimate shitpost in time for April Fools this year. However, the cost of memes has skyrocketed recently, and I need cash to fund my project. Fast. As a professional shitposter, my moral degradation knows no bounds. These ugly monkey jpgs on twitter seem to be going for insane amounts of money, and I wondered if I could somehow get in on this very legit and stable business model.

As it turns out, these jpgs are randomly generated from a select few features. The only problem is those features have to be drawn. Sure, I just have to make a dozen hats or whatever and I could get a near unlimited amount of content, but I am incredibly lazy. I just want my free money, damnit! So I begun brainstorming. What if there was a way to automate the automated pictures? Like, literally have something create original art from a template, make a hundred variations of it, and mint it all without me having to lift a finger?

I begun to study hundreds of hours of machine learning, advanced coding languages, and orphan orangutan rehabilitation videos to prepare. I created my own operating system to more efficiently control the exact levels of monke per jpg. And now, it's finally nearing its completion. I am going to become the laziest man on the planet and generate free money forever!

Here's a nice picture of the server setup so far:
