The Following Program ONLY Works With Windows

2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe ******s, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)
1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted
1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)
1 large egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4 x 8-inch loaf pan.

In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe ******s with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed ******s.

Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.

Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.

Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the ****** ***** from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A ***** knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)

Wrapped well, the ****** ***** will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.
