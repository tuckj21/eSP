
Things aren't going as planned. My server was barely able to handle the workload of creating these monkeys, let alone minting them. I ended up stealing a few parts from an abandoned Radioshack. I know, I know, it's *allegedly* haunted. It was build on a cemetery and occasionally the graphics cards are rumored to ooze blood, but honestly that just seems like watercooling with fewer steps. Win-win, am I right?

Another issue was powering this damn thing. Turns out these things are terrible for both the environment and, more importantly, my electric bill. But being the frugal gamer I am, I made my own solution. As it turns out, there was an unexploded nuclear bomb just sitting in the ocean! I won't bore you with the incredible story of how I managed to fish a warhead out the ocean and drag it 450 miles back home. All you need to know is this: you just need pliers, some copper wire, and a dream, and you too can have a homemade reactor running a possibly haunted server creating unlimited pictures of monkeys.

I've got only 24 hours left until April 1st. I'm gonna set up my camera and record me turning this baby on! I'll link it down below. Wish me luck!
